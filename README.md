## Data Structures with C++

This GitHub repository contains a collection of data structures implemented in C++. It includes implementations of various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs. Each data structure is accompanied by a detailed explanation of its implementation and usage. The repository also contains several examples of how to use the data structures in real-world applications. This repository is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about data structures and their implementation in C++.

The course I followed is called [Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/) and it's created by Abdul Bari.
