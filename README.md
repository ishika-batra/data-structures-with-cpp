## Data Structures with C++

A collection of C++ notes, exercises, and a breif introduction about Data Structures and Algorithms and rest from the course I took on Udemy. The course is called [Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/) and it's created by Abdul Bari.

For more info about a specific topic, navigate to that topic's directory and check out the readme file for the notes.
