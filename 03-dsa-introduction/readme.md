# DSA Introduction

## Data Structures
- Arrangement or organizing of data in the main memory  for efficient utilization is  called data structure.
- Dat structures are formed in the main memory during the execution time of program

## Databases
- Mostly commercial data is stored in the form of databases.
- Data organized on the data disk in the form of tables is database.

## Data Warehouse
- Historical data stored in hard disks.
- This data is used for analysis and prediction.
- Algorithms used to study this data is called data mining algorithms.

## Big Data
- Collecting and study the large amount of continuously generating data is called big data.

## Static vs Dynamic memory allocation

- Area that is occupied by the program in the main memory is called the code section.
#### Static memory allocation
- Variables declared in the program their memory will be created inside the stack.
- The portion of the memory given to a function inside the stack is called activation record of that function.
- This is static memory allocation,as how many bytes of memory is required by the function was decided at the compile time,
